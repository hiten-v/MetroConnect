# 🚇 MetroLink – Metro Booking Service

## Quick Start (5 steps)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB running locally (`mongod`)

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install       # root
cd server && npm install
cd ../client && npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment
Edit `server/.env` if needed:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/metro-booking
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Seed the database
```bash
npm run seed
```
This inserts 3 metro lines (Yellow, Blue, Pink), 70+ stations, interchange detection, and compatibility matrix.

### 4. Run dev servers
```bash
npm run dev
```
Starts both Express (`:5000`) and Vite (`:5173`) concurrently.

### 5. Open browser
- **Passenger App:** http://localhost:5173
- **Admin Panel:** http://localhost:5173/admin

## Architecture Notes
- Route finding (BFS) runs entirely client-side on the fetched network data
- Fare formula: ₹10 base + ₹2/stop + ₹5/transfer, capped at ₹60
- QR string = JSON `{ ref, from, to, ts }` rendered via `qrcode` canvas
- Map uses pure SVG with CSS `transform` for pan/zoom (no heavy library)
- DnD uses `react-beautiful-dnd`
